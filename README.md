# Timing the first multi-gain events in Multiple Myeloma
## Introduction: Molecular and absolute time in Multiple Myeloma

Most tumors and virtually all normal tissues accumulate mutations at a consistent rate, typically specific to each tissue (Alexandrov et al., Nat Gen 2015; Gerstung et al., Nature 2020; Moore et al., Nature 2021). This accumulation rate, often referred to as a biological ‘clock,’ is minimally influenced by the tissue’s replication rate (Abascal et al. Nature 2021). The estimation of this clock relies on two distinct single base substitution (SBS) signatures: SBS1 and SBS5. Notably, in both aggressive and indolent lymphoma, as well as in normal B-cells, SBS1 and SBS5 exhibit a linear correlation with patients’ age (Gerstung et al., Nature 2020; Machado et al., Nature 2020), thereby confirming the presence of the biological clock, even in the context of germinal center exposure.

Earlier studies, albeit on limited sample sizes, indicated a similar clock correlation in multiple myeloma (Rustad et al., Nat Comm 2020). Building upon these preliminary findings, our study delved into 421 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples from multiple myeloma patients to validate and expand upon these early observations. We demonstrate that the mutational burden represented by SBS1 and SBS5 can effectively serve as a temporal marker, aligning with findings in other cancer types.”
